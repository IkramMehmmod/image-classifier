# Fruit Classifier App

This is a mobile application built with Flutter that classifies fruit images using a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model. The app allows users to upload an image of a fruit and get an accurate prediction of the fruit type.

## Features

- **Image Classification:** The app uses a trained TFLite model to classify fruit images.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design to allow easy image uploads.
- **Lightweight APK:** The app is packaged into an APK and can be easily installed on any Android device.

## Installation

1. **Download the APK:**
   You can download the APK file for the Fruit Classifier app from the following link:
   [Download the APK File](https://github.com/IkramMehmmod/image-classifier/raw/main/Assets/fruit_classifier_app.apk)

2. **Install the APK:**
   Once downloaded, you can install the APK directly on your Android device. Make sure that you allow installation from unknown sources in your device's settings.

## How it Works

- The app takes an image as input through the camera or file picker.
- The image is processed using the TFLite model integrated into the app.
- The model classifies the fruit in the image and displays the result on the screen.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter:** Cross-platform development framework for building the mobile app.
- **TensorFlow Lite:** A lightweight version of TensorFlow optimized for mobile devices for on-device machine learning.
- **Dart:** The programming language used for Flutter development.

## Requirements

- Android device with version 5.0 or above.
- The app uses TensorFlow Lite models, so a stable internet connection may be required for first-time setup or updates (if applicable).
